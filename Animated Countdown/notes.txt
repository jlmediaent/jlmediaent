 transform: translate(-50%, -50%)

    a. without transform: translateX or Y we can do it in the parenthesis 

<button id="replay">replay</button>

    a. the >replay< is what is displayed on the button 

had numbs instead of numbs in the CSS and it fked things up 

In JS querySelectorAll is used if there is multiple elements you are selecting. 
    a.   const nums = document.querySelectorAll('.nums span')

function runAnimation() {
      nums.forEach((num) => {

            a. the nums for each function takes in (num, and second parameter of idx or index) which means it takes in 1 then 2 and so on 

had issue with 0% on the keyframes, was missing the % and it caused the animation to not run smoothly
