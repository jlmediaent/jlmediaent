2 box shadow order (0 x offset) 2px(y offset) 5px(blur) then color rgba(0,0,0,0.3(transparency, makes it looks like its slightly coming off the page))
3. to have a smooth transition, this case the width, the duration you want it to last and the effect
4. Display: flex; makes all items flex that will trn into a row 
5 nav ul li is 

6.nav ul li {
    transform: rotateY(0deg); (*this is what spins the menu button)
    opacity: 0; (*isn't showing whenever the ul isn't active)
    transition: transform 0.6s linear, opacity 0.6s linear;
}       

7. When targeting the li (the Home, Works, About, and Contact buttons) when the nav is active nav.active ul li {
