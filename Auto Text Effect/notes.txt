input:number produces <input type="number" name="" id="">

let idx = 1 
    a. this is an index variable 

let speed = 300 / speedEl.value

    a. this makes it faster as we increase the speed 

textEl.innerText = text.slice()

        a. .slice will give us a range of the string 

if(idx > text.length) 

    a. this checks if the index is greater than the entire length of what we have in the text, if true then it will reset the index to 1 and start over

setTimeout(writeText, speed) 

    a. we need to keep calling the write text, and it will wait a specific amount of time, in this case we want to wait whatever the speed is. 

speedEl.addEventListener('input', (e) => speed = 300 / e.target.value)

    a. this gives the speed input number functionality, so it listens for an input either from the arrows or from simply typing a number in the speed box. 

    b. the max class we set in HTML is the max it can go to
