in CSS transform: translate(-50, -50%) is about positioning the circle ripple effect on the x and y axis. 
button.addEventListener('click', (e) => { //the (e) is the event object, so we want a couple different values, where we click in the viewport, so const x and const y. 
    a. he turns them into e.clientX and e.clientY
    b. when you check the console log initially and click it gives x and y coordinates of the whole page, for instance 160px from the left and 199px from the right. 
we need the position fo the button itself, 
    a. buttonTop is the surface of the whole button only
    b. buttonLeft is starting from the left side of the screen, i am unclear if this is because its a left to right thing.

Next we need to get only different coordinates inside the button so that the ripple starts only where you click in the button.

button class in html need to be lowercase <button class="ripple">Click Me</button> as i had Ripple with a capital R and the function in the js in with the button didn't work.

this.appendChild(circle) won't work with an arrow function. 
    a.button.addEventListener('click', function (e) { so actually write function
