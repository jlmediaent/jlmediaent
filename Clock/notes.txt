Clock Theme
1. button.toggle produces <button class="toggle">Dark Mode</button>
2. .needle*3 produces <div class="needles"></div>
        <div class="needles"></div>
        <div class="needles"></div>

3. in the html i had .needles with an s, removed the s and the clock hand needle appeard in the css. 
4. in css transform-origin: bottom-center; makes the hands hand rotate at the bottom on the center of the box the hand sits in.
5.when using after .center-point::after {
    content: ''; you must add that content property at the end. 
6. Arrays in JS seem to need semi colon at the end const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul",
"Aug", "Sept", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"];

7. transform-origin: bottom center;  i had bottom-center and it caused all of the clock hands not to be aligned at the center

8. rotate(${scale(hoursForClock, 0, 12, 0, 360)}deg)`
        a. the 0 is in_min, the 11 is in_max, the 0 is out_min, and the 360 is out_max)

9. setInterval(setTime, 1000) set inerval takes in a function which is setTime and calls it every second so every 1000ms)
