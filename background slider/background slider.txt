Background Slider
1. body::before { this is adding an overlay
    content: '';
    
}
2. background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6); the last number is an overlay
3..slider-container {
    box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23);
    height: 70vh;
    width: 70vw;
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
} 
when styling specific classes you have options to consider 

4. In JS activeSlide++ means to increment by 1 with each click while activeSlide-- reduces by 1
5.  if(activeSlide  > slides.length -1 { this checks the end, slides.length (from html slide class) checks the length of the node list
        activeSlide = 0
    })
6. need a ('.slide') when using querySelectoryAll, while getElementById doesn't in the ('')
